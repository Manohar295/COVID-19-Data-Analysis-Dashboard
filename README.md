 COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Developed an interactive web-based dashboard to analyze global COVID-19 trends using real-time data from Our World in Data.

Cleaned and preprocessed large datasets to extract key metrics such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and new deaths across selected countries.

Created time-series visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib to observe trends and spikes in infection and mortality rates.

Built the dashboard using Streamlit, allowing users to dynamically select countries and visualize the impact of COVID-19 over time.

Implemented filtering, caching, and modular code for efficient performance and easy deployment.

Deployed the application locally and (optionally) on Streamlit Cloud for public access.
